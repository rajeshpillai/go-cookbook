	"## Tech Stack:\n" +
	"- Frontend: React (Vite, TypeScript, TailwindCSS)\n" +
	"- Backend: Node.js (Express, TypeScript)\n" +
	"- Database: PostgreSQL (Prisma ORM)\n" +
	"- Auth: JWT-based authentication (using bcrypt for password hashing)\n\n" +
	"## Guidelines:\n" +
	"- Use proper file structure and best practices.\n" +
	"- Generate REST API routes, controllers, and Prisma models.\n" +
	"- Create React pages and reusable components styled with TailwindCSS.\n" +
	"- Include " + bt + "package.json" + bt + " and " + bt + "tsconfig.json" + bt + " files for both frontend and backend.\n" +
	"- Use environment variables via " + bt + ".env" + bt + " for secrets and DB connection.\n" +
	"- Include sample Prisma schema and seed data if applicable.\n" +
	"- Protect API routes using JWT-based auth middleware.\n" +
	"- Provide full working code for each file.\n\n" +
